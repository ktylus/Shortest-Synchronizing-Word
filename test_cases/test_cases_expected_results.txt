"25_states.txt" - only to check how fast the program works - i created this automaton
without much thinking and i don't know that the shortest synchronizing word is.
this test shows the laziness in haskell, because the test runs surprisingly fast,
but when i ask to print the length of the power DFA states list, it takes much more time.
it is, after all, a list of 2^25 elements.
