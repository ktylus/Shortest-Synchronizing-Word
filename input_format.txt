The DFA is represented as follows:
- first line is the set of states (Q)
- second line is the alphabet (sigma)
- third line is the start state
- fourth line is the set of accepting states

Then each line after that describes a transition in the transition function (delta).
In each line there are three characters: q1, c, q2 and their meaning is that delta(q1, c) = q2.

The set of states (first line of input) must be provided in lexicographical order.
All values must be separated by space character.
All state names must consist only of a single letter.
